# GRAVITYSIM-ISH
This project is a small test to play around with CUDA and see how much faster it can be -
without putting much effort into optimising either the CPU only or CUDA implementations.

Under no circumstances should this be taken as a guide on how to do CUDA properly.
The actual simulation is not particulary accurate either and is purely intended to give something more to look at
than just numbers on stdout.
